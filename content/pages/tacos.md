### Every day is taco ipsum tuesday. 

Flour or corn tortillas? Tacos, 
again? This will be 5 times this week and it’s only Tuesday. Make it a 
double there pal. Does guac cost extra? TACOS!! How bout a gosh darn 
quesadilla? Burritos are very tasty. Black or pinto beans? If you were a
 taco, would you eat yourself? Burritos are very tasty. CARNE ASADA!! 
It’s long been rumored that the chupacabra is really just a crazed man 
who’s local taco shop went out of business. Carne asada on corn 
tortillas.

 It’s taco Tuesday Monday. Tacos, tacos, tacos. Give me
 tacos, or give me death. It’s taco time all the time. Josh’s taco shack
 is the best taco shack. If you were a taco, would you eat yourself? 
I’ve been following that taco truck around all day. CARNITAS!! It’s taco
 time all the time. It’s long been rumored that the chupacabra is really
 just a crazed man who’s local taco shop went out of business. Add in a 
few el Pastor with guac and diced onions. CARNE ASADA!!
